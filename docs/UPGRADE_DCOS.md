# Steps for DC/OS upgrade On-Premises and on Cloud Providers

In order to upgrade a cluster, you have to set the download URL for the target version of DC/OS inside of the file `group_vars/all`. So for example if you want to upgrade to DC/OS 1.11.1, specify the download URL for this version depending on DC/OS version install.

Open DC/OS Open:

```
dcos_download: https://downloads.dcos.io/dcos/stable/1.11.1/dcos_generate_config.sh
```

DC/OS Enterprise:

```
dcos_download: https://downloads.mesosphere.com/dcos-enterprise/stable/1.11.1/dcos_generate_config.ee.sh
```

## On-Premises upgrade

To start the upgrade trigger the play `plays/upgrade.yml` and specify the DC/OS version that is currently running on the cluster as the variable `installed_cluster_version`. The command for that is:

```
ansible-playbook plays/upgrade.yml --extra-vars "installed_cluster_version=1.11.0"
```

## Cloud Providers upgrade

To start the upgrade trigger the play `plays/upgrade.yml` and specify the DC/OS version that is currently running on the cluster as the variable `installed_cluster_version`. The command for that is:

```
ansible-playbook -i inventory.py plays/upgrade.yml --extra-vars "installed_cluster_version=1.11.0"
```
